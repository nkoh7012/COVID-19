# COVID-19

This project will analyze the recent trends of COVID-19 using the JHU CSSE database.

Certain questions that I want to answer are:
1) What do the trend lines look like for the entire world?
1b) What do the trends look like for one country?

2) Will ending stay-at-home durations lead to an increase of cases in all countries? Or could it be due to another issue? (ie: healthcare policy)
